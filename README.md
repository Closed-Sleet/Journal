# Journal.py
A Journal type thing for linux using the terminal.
It takes your input and the date and writes it to a .txt file named journal.txt in the same directory as Journal.py
to read your journal just open up Journal.txt

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the full python3 library.
```sudo apt-get install python3```
Remember to use ```chmod +x Journal.py``` so you can run it.

## Why?
I mainly made this script cause I was bored, but also it does serve a genuine purpose.
I usually need to write things down to remember them, while for the longest time I've been using a google doc,
that's proven unreliable now that I am without internet often. Which is usually when I want to write.
This script is mainly to make it easier to format these things and look back on.
